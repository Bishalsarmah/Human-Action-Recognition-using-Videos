# Human-Action-Recognition-using-Videos
This project showcases an action recognition system built using ConvLSTM neural networks, achieving high accuracy on the UCF50 dataset. Notable for its efficiency, the model was trained with limited computational resources, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The system supports the classification of actions such as drumming, basketball, diving, and fencing, and demonstrates the potential for high-performance video analysis with minimal hardware. The project aims to provide practical solutions where high-end computing is not feasible, optimizing for accuracy and resource efficiency.

Key Features:

ConvLSTM model for video-based action recognition.
High accuracy (92%) achieved on four select classes.
Designed for low-resource environments.
Preprocessing, training scripts, and model visualization included.
